# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-07)

**Core value:** Validated simulation-to-inference pipeline for HGF models on PRL pick_best_cue data.
**Current focus:** Milestone v1.1 Power Analysis — Phase 8 ready to plan

## Current Position

Phase: 8 - Config + Infrastructure (not started)
Plan: —
Status: Roadmap complete, ready for phase planning
Last activity: 2026-04-07 — v1.1 roadmap created (phases 8-11)

[=========>          ] Phases 7/11 complete (v1.0 shipped; v1.1 starting)

## Performance Metrics

| Metric | v1.0 Value |
|--------|------------|
| Phases shipped | 7 |
| Plans completed | 18 |
| Files created/modified | 105 |
| Lines of Python | ~11,016 |
| Days elapsed | 4 (2026-04-04 to 2026-04-07) |

## Accumulated Context

### Key Decisions

See `.planning/milestones/v1.0-ROADMAP.md` for v1.0 decision log.

| Decision | Rationale | Phase |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| MCMC throughout (no MAP proxy) | Simplicity; leverage cluster parallelism for power loop | v1.1 planning |
| Psilocybin vs placebo groups (both post-concussion) | Corrected study design | v1.1 planning |
| pingouin.bayesfactor_ttest over rpy2+anovaBF | pingouin already installed; anovaBF misspecified for RM designs (van den Bergh 2023) | v1.1 roadmap |
| SLURM array %50 throttle | Prevents Lustre metadata import storm on M3 MASSIVE | v1.1 roadmap |
| omega_3 BFDA labeled "exploratory — upper bound" | Recovery r ~ 0.67 with binary data; naive BFDA inflates power 20-40pp | v1.1 roadmap |
| SeedSequence for parallel RNG | task-ID integer seeding gives correlated streams; SeedSequence guarantees independence | v1.1 roadmap |
| power/ package wraps existing pipeline; no existing module modified | Eliminates regression risk; all existing functions called unchanged | v1.1 roadmap |

### Pending Todos

- manuscript/references.bib: mason2024 volume/page details need verification before submission
- quarto-arxiv extension must be installed before first arxiv-pdf render
- Phase 9 kappa effect size parameterization: verify kappa entry point in GroupConfig vs SessionConfig during make_power_config unit tests (Phase 8) before cluster submission
- Phase 10: run 100-iteration MAP vs NUTS pilot before committing to full NUTS budget

### Blockers/Concerns

- System Python 3.13 incompatible with pyhgf 0.2.8 — all work must use ds_env
- omega_3 parameter recovery expected to be challenging (known issue in literature)
- MCMC-based power loop is compute-heavy (~200-300 cluster-hours estimated)
- SLURM %50 throttle tuned from general guidance — verify empirically in Phase 8 smoke test

## Quick Tasks

| ID  | Name | Status | Summary |
|-----|------|--------|---------|
| 001 | Cluster GPU Setup & Smoke Test | Complete | M3 SLURM infrastructure + smoke test PASS |
